I can't wait until I graduate and have time to read a big book on algorithms.

A couple weeks ago Cassidy Williams (@cassidoo) came to speak to our class about technical interviewing.  She was great and so was her talk. But like her guide to getting hired, it was geared toward computer science grads.

Our class got scared being told we were going to be interviewed on the technical questions we'd never even heard of.  And sure, I suppose it will happen, but if you end up in an antagonistic interviewing situation that's kind of the company's mistake.  If you're a company hiring a bootcamp grad you probably know what you're going to get.  We are what we are: 90% enthusiasm, 10% experience.
